Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The point of this of the first project was to be able top cause the led on the board to blink the equivalent of hello world while the second final project was to control the led with the temp that you are setting. This is through the peripherals built into the board

What did you do particularly well?
For the first project one thing that I did well was really dive deep into the zybooks and reading material to make sure that  I understood all of the information from the directions and making sure I understood what the animation is that the zybooks was trying to teach me.

For the second Project what I did well was exhausted my resources. This really push my ability to figure out what was wrong when the many things that did go wrong happened.

Where could you improve?
For both I feel like I could improve in my time management because many issues became an issue because of the amount of time I spent in each project. Sometimes you dont need a 5 minute break every 20 minutes.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
For both since this was my first class like this most of tool that I acquired were reading documentation and making sure I was looking at discussion post. Alot of reading is when helped me figure these things out.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Being able to physically work withs something was a first for me so one thing that I looked into when I had issue with the board was something on the board was broken. Because before it was just code that had a bug. Now I need to be observant on if somethin g beyond the code was broken.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This is really simple as it is just following popper coding practice. This includes naming things and leaving comments. Also having popper white space usage. All of these small things amount to something bigger in the long run.
